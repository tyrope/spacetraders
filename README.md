# stcommander
A Unity client for the headless API game "Space Traders" - Because commanding a trading fleet from a spaceship bridge is cool.

## How to use
When I consider this client stable enough for public use, there will be a [release](/releases) that's ready to go without using the Unity Editor.

## How to use (Advanced users ONLY)
Don't like the above answer? Fine, install Unity Editor 2022.1.23f1, and load the project. If you have to ask me how, you're not an advanced user.

## FAQ:
### Q) Can you add [insert_feature_here]?
A) No. Maybe. [File an issue](issues/new?template=feature_request.md) and it'll be ~~ignored~~ given the attention it deserves.
### Q) It's broken!
A) Not a question, but [file an issue](/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) *with details*.
### Q) X is broke and I have a fix!
A) Again, not a question... But please, [create a pull request](/pulls).
